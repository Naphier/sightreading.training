A tool for practicing sight reading, learning songs, and training other musical skills in your browser. The successor to <https://github.com/leafo/mursic>.

## Frontend development

The frontend is a React app that can be developed without the backend (Lua,
PostgreSQL, tup). All you need is Node:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then open <http://localhost:3000/>. The dev server bundles with esbuild,
watches for changes, and reloads the page automatically. Backend-only features
(login, stats, the play-along song library) will not function in this mode;
everything else works, including MIDI input and output.

To generate a CSV table of every Note Math interval calculation for review and
include it in a pull request as verification:

```bash
mkdir -p dev/out && npm run --silent note_math_csv > dev/out/note-math.csv
```

## Remote development with GitHub Codespaces

To test a pull-request branch without installing anything locally:

1. Open the pull request on GitHub, select **Code**, then **Codespaces**, and
   create a codespace on the pull-request branch.
2. Wait for the container setup to finish. Locked dependencies are installed and the frontend preview starts
   automatically.
3. If the preview is not running, run `bash dev/start_preview.sh` in the Codespaces terminal.
4. When Codespaces forwards port 3000, select **Open in Browser**. If the
   notification is missed, open the **Ports** panel and use the globe icon next
   to **Sight Reading Trainer**.
5. Visit `/flash-cards/note-math` on the forwarded HTTPS URL.

The forwarded site runs in the codespace; only the browser is local. The
frontend-only limitations below still apply.

The full site build (backend + minified production assets) uses the
[tup](https://gittup.org/tup/) build system, see the Tupfiles in the repo.


## Trainer preferences and hit statistics

Signed-in accounts store trainer preferences in PostgreSQL; guests store them in
localStorage. Configure panel choices, Wait/Scroll mode, speed, keyboard visibility,
and the panel's open state are restored. Account preferences load with the session
and save automatically, with a separate per-account device cache. The page reports
failed account saves and retries when another setting changes or connectivity returns.
Account settings use last-write-wins behavior across devices.

Run `lapis migrate` before deploying this version: the migration adds the
`users.trainer_preferences` JSONB column. Production PostgreSQL must use persistent
storage (a volume or an external database) to retain preferences and existing hit
history across container replacement. The repository's Dockerfile is for CI;
it does not define a persistent production deployment.

Reset clears the current practice session's hits, misses, streak, last streak, and
per-note timing data. It preserves pending uploads and account history. Last streak
shows the most recently ended nonzero streak, including after consecutive misses.
The Stats page reports the best daily hits and average hits per active day across
all account history, grouped using the viewer's timezone offset. An active day has
at least one recorded hit or miss; inactive days are excluded from the average.

### Create a Codespaces preview from the command line

With a personal GitHub CLI login that has Codespaces access:

```bash
gh auth login
gh auth refresh -h github.com -s codespace
bash dev/create_codespace.sh codex/trainer-memory-and-stats
```

The helper reuses a codespace for that branch or creates one using the smallest
available machine, a 30-minute idle timeout and seven-day stopped retention.
Creating or running a codespace consumes your GitHub Codespaces quota. The branch
must already be pushed. Open the printed URL, wait for setup, then use **Ports →
3000 → Open in Browser**. New forwarded ports default to private; verify
**Port Visibility → Private** when reusing a codespace. The devcontainer automatically
starts the preview when the codespace starts; `dev/out/preview.log` contains logs.
When reusing a codespace, update its checkout to the latest branch commit after
preserving any local work. If it predates this devcontainer update, rebuild its container
or run `bash dev/start_preview.sh` manually after updating the checkout.

This is a frontend-only preview. Check guest settings by changing Configure options,
Mode, Speed and keyboard visibility, then reloading. Build a streak, miss a note,
and verify Last Streak stays visible through more misses. Reset should zero the
session counters. Account sync and account Stats need a backend-enabled deployment.

## Full-backend production runtime

Production requires `SR_STAGE` (`dev` or `prd`), `SR_PUBLIC_URL` (an HTTPS origin
without a trailing slash), `SR_DB_HOST`, `SR_DB_NAME`, `SR_DB_USER`, and the
`SR_DB_PASSWORD` / `SR_SESSION_SECRET` secrets. Each secret may instead be read
from its corresponding `_FILE` path; do not supply both sources. Session secrets
must have at least 32 characters and differ between stages. Secret inputs are
limited to 4096 bytes; file reads are bounded and trim trailing CR/LF. Public
hostnames are validated and normalized to lowercase. Missing production
configuration fails closed. Keep these values outside the repository.

The production process runs in the foreground, uses secure host-only session
cookies, and rejects unexpected Host headers. `GET /_health/ready` checks database
connectivity and the required trainer-preferences schema; it returns 503 without
database error details when unavailable. Internal health clients must send the
configured public hostname in their Host header. Deployment scripts and server
configuration live in the private operations repository.

Backend CI uses the root Dockerfile as a disposable test runner with stable Lapis
and PostgreSQL. Generate assets with `npm ci && npm run build_assets`, then run
`docker build -t sightreading-test .` and `docker run --rm sightreading-test`.
Its database is local to that throwaway container; do not run `ci.sh` on a host.
The script checks an image-only marker before changing PostgreSQL configuration.
It discovers MoonScript specs once, excluding their generated Lua copies. The CI
image uses Debian PostgreSQL 15; the private runtime integration also checks the
production PostgreSQL 17 stack.

## Adding practice tools

Follow the [new-tool playbook](docs/adding-tools.md) for routes, navigation,
state persistence, audio lifecycle, accessibility, verification, and PR previews.

### Drum Machine

Open **Drum Machine** in the navigation or visit `/drum-machine`. Toggle hits across
eight synthesized percussion tracks, mute instruments, set 30–240 BPM, and add
eighth-note swing. Choose 4/4, 3/4, 5/4, or 6/8 with one or two bars; extending
repeats the first bar. In 6/8, BPM counts dotted quarters and swing is disabled. Eighteen editable presets cover rock, funk, blues, hip-hop, dance, and more.
Use the top-right Your patterns selector and save/new/delete icons to manage up to
100 named patterns on the current browser. New and Save open a naming dialog and preserve the current beat;
confirming selects the named pattern in the dropdown. Saving the same name replaces
it. These patterns are local and do not sync to accounts. Playback uses Web Audio
and stops when leaving the page. No external drum samples or MIDI setup are needed.
